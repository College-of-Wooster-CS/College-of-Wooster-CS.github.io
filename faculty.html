            My research interests are in graph theory and algorithms, with a focus in the broad category of hyperbolic graphs and several interesting graph classes including Helly graphs, distance-hereditary graphs, AT-free graphs, and chordal graphs.
            I am largely interested in facility location problems and large-scale network analysis.
            My additional research interests include software engineering and algorithmic applications, such as mining software repositories and network visualization.
    
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I particularly enjoy finding clean and aesthetic solutions to difficult problems in a manner that is easy to present and explain. One of my passions (in teaching, in research, and for sport) is exploring new and creative ways to solve problems.

            My research interests are in software engineering and program comprehension, specifically with a focus on using eye tracking to provide real-time cognitive insights as software developers read and build mental models of source code stimulus.
            My objective is to use findings in these eye tracking studies to help inform the development of supporting tools and education in software development and engineering.
            I am also a developer/contributor on the NSF funded i-Trace project (http://www.i-trace.org/).    
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Outside of computer science research, I am interested in other applications of eye-tracking in the humanities and social sciences, education, health care, art and areas of research for interdisciplinary collaboration.

            My research focuses on swarm intelligence and multi-agent systems, with a particular emphasis on human swarms and blended intelligence (humans and swarms working together).
            I use collectives of humans to discover and mimic swarm algorithms, and to test swarm algorithms that we have developed.
            I have also delved into Software engineering, particularly agile development processes.
            Once upon a time, I co-wrote a textbook on this subject.
            Computation is logic that has come alive, so I am fascinated by logic puzzles, unusual problem-solving techniques, and computational curiosities like Conway’s Game of Life, Langton’s Ant, and artificial life.

        <p>
            I focus on applied machine learning for solving real-world problems and on developing algorithms for classifying imbalanced data.
            I collaborate on bioinformatics projects with researchers from The Ohio State University and the University of Georgia.
            My main satisfaction comes from working with Wooster undergraduates on projects related to identifying genes that regulate size and shape in tomato fruit.
            Our collaborative research with over 28 undergraduates has resulted in thirteen published research articles.
