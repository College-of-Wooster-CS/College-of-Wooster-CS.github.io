    <h1 id="help-heading">LaTeX</h1>
    <p class="hours-text">
        Most computer science academic writing is produced using the <a href='https://www.latex-project.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>LaTeX</a> typesetting system, and using LaTeX is required for this project.
        The computer science senior IS also requires using LaTeX, so this is good preparation for your IS.
        There are a number of ways to install LaTeX.
        The most popular distributions are <a href='https://miktex.org/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>MiKTeX</a> on Windows, <a href='https://tug.org/mactex/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>MacTeX</a> on macOS, and <a href='https://tug.org/texlive/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>TeX Live</a> on Linux (which is very likely installable through the package manager of your Linux distribution).
        There are a huge number of tutorials on how to use LaTeX, such as those on <a href='https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Overleaf</a>.
        Overleaf is a (sometimes paid) online LaTeX compiler which does not have as many free capabilities as the LaTeX installations.
        There is another excellent resources for LaTeX info <a href='https://infoguides.gmu.edu/LaTeX' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>here</a>.
