    <h1 id="opportunities-heading">Research & Internships</h1>
    <p class="opportunities-text">
        We encourage all of our students to find opportunities to apply their skills to a research opportunity or internship.
        Below includes a number of possibilities where students can find such positions.  
        <br><br>
        In addition to searching via google, LinkedIn, or other search engines, students can use the college's Advising, Planning, and Experiential Learning Center (APEX) to help them <a href='https://apex.wooster.edu/channels/finding-internships/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>find an internship</a>.
        If the internship is unpaid or underpaid, APEX also offers competitive <a href='https://apex.wooster.edu/channels/apex-fellowship/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>fellowships</a> to help supplement a stipend for the student.
        As we are contacted by businesses or potential employers, we also post opportunities regularly to the <a href='https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Ad9aa1f30596d4c999a306586fad69395%40thread.tacv2/Opportunities?groupId=95de8f13-ce83-463d-b355-567fd6fc8d95&tenantId=9ef017d9-7f05-4225-9838-f92cff57b7ab' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Opportunities Channel</a> of the Mathematical and Computational Sciences Microsoft Teams organization.
        A student can also opt to work with a faculty mentor in order to <a href='https://apex.wooster.edu/channels/experiential-learning-in-the-classroom/#uc_resource_tiles-54' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>count their internship for academic credit</a> (0.25, 0.5, or 1 credit depending on the number of hours worked).  
        <br><br>
        Over the summer, the college offers a competitive <a href='https://inside.wooster.edu/amre/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Applied Methods and Research Experience (AMRE)</a> program in which a group of students are paired with faculty mentors to consult for a business, industry, or agency client to solve real-world problems.
        There is an open call for applications in the spring on Microsoft Teams. 
        <br><br>
        Finally, we have a number of research opportunities available to students.
        The <a href='https://inside.wooster.edu/academic-affairs/research/sophomore/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Sophomore Research Program</a> allows students to work with a faculty advisor on a specific research project during the Fall, Spring, or Summer.
        Students can also apply to any off-campus location as found in the <a href='https://new.nsf.gov/funding/initiatives/reu/search?f%5b0%5d=reu_research_area:25737' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>U.S. National Science Foundation Research Experiences for Undergraduates (NSF REU)</a> to explore other summer research opportunities.
