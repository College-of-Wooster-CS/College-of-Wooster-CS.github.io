                Beginning with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, students are introduced to the important tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system.
                Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), and file systems.

                This course is a hands-on introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence.
                The main question addressed is: How can we design good computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience (e.g. similar to the way humans learn)?
                Multiple machine learning models are examined.
                The goal of the course is that students begin to understand some of the issues and challenges facing machine learning while being exposed to the pragmatics of implementing machine learning systems.
