                (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping),
                and file systems.

                This course is a hands-on introduction to machine learning and artificial intelligence. The main question addressed is:
                How can we design good computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience (e.g. similar to the way humans
                learn)? Multiple machine learning models are examined. The goal of the course is that students begin to understand some of
                the issues and challenges facing machine learning while being exposed to the pragmatics of implementing machine learning
                systems.
