            <h2 class="home-heading">Why Wooster Computer Science?</h2>
            <p class="home-body">
                Our students have the opportunity to take courses on a wide variety of topics, from networking and graphics, to databases and machine intelligence.
                Python, C, Java, software engineering, algorithm analysis, and SQL are just a sample of the languages and skills students will learn throughout the program.
                Our faculty's research covers a broad range of interests including swarm intelligence, graph theory, bioinformatics, and program comprehension.

        <div class="text-block">
            <h2 class="home-heading">Excellence Beyond the Classroom</h2>
            <p class="home-body">
                Our students are strongly encouraged to extend what they learn in the classroom through research opportunities and practical application.
                In recent years, computer science majors have undertaken projects for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Progressive Insurance, and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, among others.
                Our students participate in off-campus hackathons, programming challenges, presentations at conferences, workshops on Google interviewing strategies, and demonstrations of the CS virtual reality hardware systems.
