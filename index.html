                <!-- Here you can learn about courses, Independent Study, internships, post-grad opportunities, resources for CS students,  and more. -->
                Our Computer Science program will prepare you for the workforce and graduate school. In recent years, many of our graduates have entered the industry as software developers, engineers, consultants, and project managers, while others pursue graduate degrees. Our active alumni network talks to our majors about careers after Wooster and contacts us about job opportunities.

            <p class="home-body">
                We are a small, close-knit community of highly engaged students and faculty. We incorporate active learning in our classes to promote communication and collaboration.
                If you visit us, you will notice an open area on our floor where students work and socialize.
                We host or participate in community-building events such as:
                <br>
                · Colloquia on research topics and industry opportunities with guest speakers from Google, Microsoft, etc.
                <br>
                · Hackathons
                <br>
                · Programming competitions
                <br>
                · Google Code Club meetings, including workshops for technical resumes and practice code interviews
                <br>
                · Community activities such as game nights and departmental picnic
                <br><br>
                We have several resources to support students, including:
                <br>
                · Our Development Lab has specialized high-performance computers and virtual reality systems that students can leverage for personal and class projects.
                <br>
                · Access to the Ohio Supercomputer Center
                <br>
                · CS STEM Zone provides peer mentorship and course assistance.

                <!-- Our students have the opportunity to take courses on a wide variety of topics, from networking and graphics, to databases and machine intelligence.
                Python, C, Java, software engineering, algorithm analysis, and SQL are just a sample of the languages and skills students will learn throughout the program.
                Our faculty's research covers a broad range of interests including swarm intelligence, graph theory, bioinformatics, and program comprehension. -->

            <!-- <h2 class="home-heading">Excellence Beyond the Classroom</h2> -->
            <p class="home-body">
                Our students are strongly encouraged to extend what they learn in the classroom through research and internship experience, which we support through the following:
                <br>
                · All our students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a rigorous year-long independent study, which includes a significant software component developed by the student. Some exemplary theses can be found here.
                <br>
                · Applied Methods and Research Experience (AMRE) enables students to collaborate as a team of paid software developer consultants for businesses and organizations with the guidance of a faculty advisor. Recent clients include the National Security Agency, Goodyear, Progressive Insurance, and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center.
                <br>
                · Our students often use their AMRE experience to make their applications more competitive to off-campus summer programs such as the National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates, where they gain additional expertise.
                <br>
                · APEX Fellowships provide financial support and mentorship to students engaged in unpaid or underpaid internships in their field of interest.
                <br>
                · The Sophomore Research Program (SOREP) allows students to work as paid computer science research assistants. Recent projects include large-scale analysis of software ecosystems, machine learning, virtual reality, and eye-tracking studies.
                <br>
                · Attend conferences to present collaborative student and faculty research. Recent work with students has been published at venues such as the ACM Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education, IEEE International Conference on Mining Software Repositories, and the National Council for Undergraduate Research.

                <!-- Our students are strongly encouraged to extend what they learn in the classroom through research opportunities and practical application.
                In recent years, computer science majors have undertaken projects for the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, Progressive Insurance, and the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, among others.
                Our students participate in off-campus hackathons, programming challenges, presentations at conferences, workshops on Google interviewing strategies, and demonstrations of the CS virtual reality hardware systems. -->
